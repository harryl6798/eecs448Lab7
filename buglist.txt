Bug List!

1. Does not detect properly if the list has values. isEmpty() still returns true
2. AddBack() doesn't properly add to the back of the list. Kinda psuedo adds the values to the front instead. Still adds a value however.
3. RemoveBack() Doesn't remove the back function at all, it removes another value.
4. RemoveFront() Doesn't remove the front at all, it seems to remove the back.
5. Both RemoveBack() and RemoveFront() fail to keep track of their each individual sizes
6.
